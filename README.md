## About
This script finds image duplicates in a certain directory and deletes all of them.

Actually really useful script! I found over 200 duplicates on my PC.

Love automatization with python <3

## How it works
We iterate over every image in a directory and all of its subdirectories and create a hash for each image. Then we compare those hashes and if we find duplicate hashes it means we have duplicate images. So we can delete those duplicate images.
